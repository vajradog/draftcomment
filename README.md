Created this for a friend to demonstrate a simple way to set comments as 'draft' by default and then moderate them to 'approve'. Only 'approved' comments will appear to the site visitors.

This quick demo is completely bare-bone rails app (except for Zurb Foundation) and has no authentication, validation etc. built in (which you would probably want for a real site). The purpose is just to demonstrate the simple method of moderating comments. No moderation gems, just plain logic.
